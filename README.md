HKFGCN
HKFGCN consists of three main steps:
First, we construct two similarity networks and a microbial-drug association network based on a large amount of biological data.
Second, we use two types of encoders to extract features from both networks. On this basis, we further obtain Gaussian kernel signatures from the drug and microbial signatures obtained at each layer and perform fusion.
Finally, we reconstructed the two-part microbial-drug map based on the learned representations.
